## Creating the Documents

### Report Writing Guidelines

1. **Start with Title Page**: Follow PDF requirements exactly
2. **Write Each Part Separately**: Focus on PS1, PS2, and voting analysis
3. **Integrate Visualizations**: Reference figures from `../visualizations/`
4. **Include Code References**: Link to specific scripts and notebooks
5. **Cite Appropriately**: Credit all sources, tools, and collaborators
6. **Proofread Carefully**: Ensure clarity, coherence, and correctness

### Poster Design Tips

1. **Keep It Visual**: Use more figures, less text
2. **Tell a Story**: Guide viewers through your research
3. **Highlight Key Results**: Focus on most important findings
4. **Make It Readable**: Large fonts, clear contrast
5. **Include QR Code**: Link to GitHub repository
6. **Practice Your Pitch**: Prepare 2-minute explanation

### Reflection Writing Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Cite concrete examples from field trip
2. **Make Connections**: Link observations to research
3. **Be Reflective**: Discuss learning and growth
4. **Include Evidence**: Photos, notes, conversations
5. **Look Forward**: How does this inform future work?

## Integration with Repository

All documentation should reference and integrate with other components:

- **Theoretical Models**: Link to `../economist/`
