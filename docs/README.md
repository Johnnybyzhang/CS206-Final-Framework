# Documentation Hub

The `docs` folder aggregates the narrative deliverables required by the final research proposal: the main report and field-trip reflection.

## Files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Report.md`](Report.md) | Full proposal integrating Parts 1â€“3, simulation evidence, and design recommendations. |
| [`FieldTripReflection.md`](FieldTripReflection.md) | Reflection linking experiential learning to research design and SDGs. |

PDF exports can be generated from the Markdown sources using any Markdown-to-PDF tool (e.g., `pandoc`). The repository keeps the Markdown versions under version control to maximise transparency and diffability.
