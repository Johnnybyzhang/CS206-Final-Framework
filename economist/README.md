# Economist - Theoretical Analysis

This folder contains all theoretical analysis related to game theory, welfare economics, and fairness evaluation.

## Contents

### Game Theory Models
- **Strategic Form Games**: Normal form representations, payoff matrices
- **Extensive Form Games**: Game trees, sequential moves, subgame perfection
- **Bayesian Games**: Incomplete information, belief systems, Bayes-Nash equilibria

### Equilibrium Analysis
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria
- **Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE)**: Backward induction, credible threats
- **Bayes-Nash Equilibrium**: Equilibria under uncertainty
- **Correlated Equilibrium**: Coordinated strategy profiles

### Welfare and Efficiency
- **Pareto Efficiency**: Analysis of efficient allocations
- **Social Welfare Functions**: Utilitarian, egalitarian, and Rawlsian approaches
- **Fairness Concepts**: Envy-freeness, proportionality, equitability

## Methodology

### Theoretical Framework
Based on Problem Set 1 (PS1) from the budgeted-vickrey repository, we:
1. Formalize the strategic environment
2. Define player sets, strategy spaces, and payoff functions
3. Identify all relevant equilibrium concepts
4. Analyze efficiency and fairness properties

### Key Questions
- What are the equilibrium strategies in this game?
- Is the equilibrium outcome Pareto efficient?
- How do different equilibrium concepts compare?
- What are the welfare implications of various strategy profiles?

## Tools and References

### Theoretical Resources
- Game Theory textbooks (Osborne & Rubinstein, Fudenberg & Tirole)
- Nobel Prize lectures on mechanism design
- Arrow's impossibility theorem
- Buchanan's work on institutional design

### Computational Validation
All theoretical results are validated computationally in the [`computational_scientist/`](../computational_scientist/) folder.

## Integration with Other Components

- **Computational Science**: Theoretical models are implemented and solved in Python
- **Behavioral Science**: Theoretical predictions are tested against human/AI behavior
- **Mechanism Design**: Equilibrium analysis informs mechanism design proposals
