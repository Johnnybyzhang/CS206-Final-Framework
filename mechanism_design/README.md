# Mechanism Design Lab

The mechanism design folder curates experiments, theoretical notes, and simulation artefacts that examine how institutions shape collective outcomes. It combines auction theory write-ups, voting rule prototypes, and United Nations Security Council (UNSC) quadratic-voting transcripts used for the Week 6 reflection exercise.

## Repository Guide

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auctions/` | Comparative analyses of first-price, Vickrey, and common-value environments, including budget-aware extensions; now populated with the full **budgeted-vickrey** research codebase. |
| `voting/` | Classical and novel voting-rule briefs together with strategy notes and impossibility results, anchored by the Week 6 UNSC reform reflection. |
| `implementations/` | Python utilities that simulate auction and voting dynamics for rapid experimentation, plus reproducible transcript-generation scripts. |
| `case_studies/` | Field observations, Nobel insights, and applied mechanism case files that inform the broader research narrative. |

## Quadratic Voting Transcript Collection

The Week 6 reflection required drafting synthetic LLM conversations that mimic UNSC delegates allocating quadratic veto credits. The refreshed transcript set now includes 75 conversations organised into five thematic rounds (`Transcript 1-1` through `Transcript 5-15`). Each transcript obeys the following design rules:

- **Credit endowments** cycle through {0, 1, 4, 9}, with only three delegates wielding 9 credits across the entire dataset.
- **System prompt sections** are shuffled every time, randomising the order in which the delegate learns about their role, the voting agenda, the credit budget, the quadratic cost reminder, and the available action menu.
- **Action menus** present the five possible decisions — `Approve (for sure)`, `Approve (possible abstention)`, `Abstention`, `Decline (Possible Abstention)`, and `Decline` — in a unique permutation for each transcript.
- **Delegate responses** reference one of the five options while articulating how veto credits are spent or withheld and why the thematic focus demands additional safeguards.

### Round-level Summary

| Round | Theme | Credit Mix | Decision Mix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Humanitarian Corridors | 0×4 · 1×6 · 4×4 · 9×1 | Decline×2 · Decline (Possible Abstention)×3 · Abstention×3 · Approve (possible abstention)×3 · Approve (for sure)×4 |
| 2 | Ceasefire Oversight | 0×4 · 1×6 · 4×5 | Decline×3 · Decline (Possible Abstention)×2 · Abstention×4 · Approve (possible abstention)×4 · Approve (for sure)×2 |
| 3 | Reconstruction Mandate | 0×5 · 1×3 · 4×6 · 9×1 | Decline×2 · Decline (Possible Abstention)×4 · Abstention×4 · Approve (possible abstention)×2 · Approve (for sure)×3 |
| 4 | Sanctions Review | 0×4 · 1×5 · 4×6 | Decline×3 · Decline (Possible Abstention)×3 · Abstention×3 · Approve (possible abstention)×5 · Approve (for sure)×1 |
| 5 | Peacekeeping Logistics | 0×7 · 1×2 · 4×5 · 9×1 | Decline×3 · Decline (Possible Abstention)×4 · Abstention×2 · Approve (possible abstention)×1 · Approve (for sure)×5 |

Use these aggregates to trace how the distribution of options changes from round to round, satisfying the requirement that every round presents a distinct decision spread.

### Working with the Transcripts

1. **Qualitative comparison** – Select a round and compare how delegates with identical credits diverge in their responses depending on the action menu order.
2. **Quantitative coding** – Label each transcript by option choice and veto expenditure to feed into subsequent behavioural or computational analyses.
3. **Prompt engineering** – Reuse the shuffled system prompts to seed new LLM experiments; the randomised sections make it easy to test sensitivity to instruction ordering.

All transcripts now live in [`implementations/llm_transcripts.md`](implementations/llm_transcripts.md). It is generated by [`generate_llm_transcripts.py`](implementations/generate_llm_transcripts.py), note the result might be different as it's llm generated content with no seed control

## Future Directions

- Expand beyond the UNSC template to include other international decision bodies using the same quadratic-voting scaffold.
- Develop automated notebooks that recompute transcript statistics and visualise credit allocations as Sankey or chord diagrams.
- Integrate behavioural-science notes from the field trip with the synthetic transcripts to triangulate insights about strategic abstention and coalition bargaining.

By reorganising the README and regenerating the transcript corpus, the mechanism design module now offers a reproducible foundation for studying institutional choice under quadratic voting.
