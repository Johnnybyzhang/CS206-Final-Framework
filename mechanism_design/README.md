## Auction Design

### Problem Set 2 Context
Building on PS2 from the budgeted-vickrey repository, we analyze:
- How bidders behave in different auction formats
- The winner's curse in common-value auctions
- Bounded rationality and overbidding
- Mechanism design for budget constraints

### Auction Formats Analyzed

#### 1. First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction
- **Rules**: Highest bidder wins, pays their bid
- **Strategy**: Bid shading below valuation
- **Properties**: Not truthful, revenue considerations

#### 2. Second-Price (Vickrey) Auction
- **Rules**: Highest bidder wins, pays second-highest bid
- **Strategy**: Truthful bidding is dominant
- **Properties**: Incentive compatible, revenue equivalence

#### 3. Common-Value Auction
- **Rules**: Item has same value to all, but unknown
- **Challenge**: Winner's curse - winners systematically overpay
- **Mitigation**: Bayesian updating, conservative bidding

#### 4. Budgeted Mechanisms
- **Constraint**: Bidders have limited budgets
- **Innovation**: Mechanism design with budget feasibility
- **Applications**: Ad auctions, resource allocation

### Experimental Design

1. **Theoretical Predictions**: Compute equilibrium bidding strategies
2. **Human Experiments**: Test with classmates in oTree
3. **AI Experiments**: Compare LLM bidding to human behavior
4. **Analysis**: Identify deviations, bounded rationality patterns

## Voting Mechanism Design

### Nobel Insights Integration

#### Arrow's Impossibility Theorem
- No voting system can satisfy all desirable properties simultaneously
- Trade-offs in democratic design

#### Buchanan on Institutions
- Rules and constraints shape collective outcomes
- Constitutional design considerations

#### Hurwicz-Maskin-Myerson on Mechanism Design
- Incentive compatibility
- Implementation theory
- Revelation principle

#### Shapley-Roth on Matching
- Stable matching algorithms
- Deferred acceptance mechanism
- Applications to school choice, organ donation

#### Acemoglu-Johnson-Robinson on Institutions
- Political institutions and economic outcomes
- Legitimacy and inclusiveness

### Voting Rules Analyzed

#### Classical Rules
1. **Plurality**: Most votes wins (strategic voting issues)
2. **Borda Count**: Ranked preferences, points-based
3. **Approval Voting**: Approve any number of candidates
4. **Condorcet Methods**: Pairwise majority comparisons

#### Novel Mechanisms
1. **Quadratic Voting**: Intensity of preferences through cost function
2. **Liquid Democracy**: Delegative voting with transitive proxies
3. **Blockchain Governance**: Decentralized, transparent voting
4. **AI-Assisted Aggregation**: Machine learning for preference learning

### Field Trip Inspiration

Drawing from the field trip to innovation hubs, we explore:
- Real-world governance challenges (UN climate negotiations, DAO governance)
- Blockchain-based voting in decentralized organizations
- Algorithmic matching in markets
- Sustainable mechanism design

## Implementation and Evaluation

### Simulation Framework

```python
from implementations.auction_simulator import AuctionSimulator
from implementations.voting_system import VotingMechanism

# Auction simulation
auction = AuctionSimulator(auction_type="vickrey", num_bidders=5)
results = auction.run(valuations=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Voting simulation
voting = VotingMechanism(rule="borda")
outcome = voting.aggregate_preferences(ballots)
```

### Evaluation Criteria

#### Auction Mechanisms
- **Efficiency**: Does highest-value bidder win?
- **Revenue**: How much revenue does seller generate?
- **Incentive Compatibility**: Is truthful bidding optimal?
- **Fairness**: Do all bidders have equal opportunity?

#### Voting Mechanisms
- **Pareto Efficiency**: No Pareto improvements possible?
- **Strategy-Proofness**: Is truthful voting optimal?
- **Anonymity**: Do voter identities not matter?
- **Monotonicity**: More support never hurts a candidate?

## Case Studies

### 1. Budgeted Vickrey Auction
- Extend Vickrey auction to budget-constrained bidders
- Analyze equilibrium with budget constraints
- Compare to standard Vickrey outcomes

### 2. Blockchain-Based Voting
- Design transparent, tamper-proof voting mechanism
- Use smart contracts for vote tallying
- Ensure privacy and verifiability

### 3. Climate Agreement Mechanism
- Inspired by field trip observations
- Design mechanism for international cooperation
- Balance sovereignty with collective action
