# Mechanism Design Case Files

This dossier packages qualitative observations, Nobel-linked insights, and applied design cases that feed the broader mechanism design research agenda.

## Field Observation Log

- **Status**: Unable to attend the scheduled field trip; instead, reflections draw on remote synthesis work.
- **Collage substitute**: Paired Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Tencent Cloud to contrast global infrastructure backbones supporting agent-based simulation, econometric pipelines, and managed ML workflows.
- **Promise vs. peril**: Computational game theory enables large-scale policy experimentation while introducing risks—tacit algorithmic collusion, biased outcomes, and governance gaps—highlighted by UNESCO (2021) and NIST (2023).
- **Regulatory contrast**:
  - *United States*: Relies on voluntary, sector-collaborative frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
  - *China*: Implements prescriptive measures for algorithmic recommendation services (2022 provisions) alongside strategic guidance.
- **Ethics & SDGs**: Responsible AI practice advances SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) and SDG 16 (peace, justice, strong institutions) through transparency, accountability, and fair decision systems.
- **Liberal-arts throughline**: Broad, contextual training surfaces normative assumptions, supports data stewardship, and encourages participatory design—capacities reinforced by Duke Kunshan University’s interdisciplinary model.

## Case Study: UNSC Veto Reform and Intensity Expression

- **Backdrop**: The Security Council currently requires nine affirmative votes and zero vetoes from the Permanent Five. Russia/USSR has used its veto 159 times, the United States 93, China 21, with the UK and France abstaining from vetoes since 1989.
- **Scenario framing**: Analyse a humanitarian intervention vote with the veto removed to explore the efficiency–inclusivity trade-off.
- **Stakeholder blocs**: Western allies (A→B→C), Russia/China (C→B→A), emerging powers (B→A→C), and the affected region (A→B→C) reveal divergent intensities over intervention.
- **Mechanism implications**:
  - *Buchanan (1986)*: Vetoes resemble unanimity devices that cut external losses for great powers but inflate decision costs. Graduated thresholds plus side-payments can balance the trade-off once vetoes disappear.
  - *Hurwicz–Maskin–Myerson (2007)*: Mechanism design reframes veto bargaining as an incentive problem; Vickrey–Clarke–Groves-style credits and documented rationales can align self-interest with collective welfare.
  - *Shapley–Roth (2012)*: Stability demands compensating pivotal players—issue bundling, rotations, and Shapley-value-inspired transfers keep coalitions intact.
  - *Acemoglu–Johnson–Robinson (2024)*: Inclusive decision rules boost legitimacy but require transparency and norms to prevent backlash from former veto holders.
- **Design response**: Quadratic voting with veto credits allocates issue-specific budgets (1 credit→1 vote, 4→2, 9→3) so members express intensity at rising cost, recorded on a permissioned blockchain for audit trails.
- **Expected outcomes**: Fairer intensity signalling, prioritised veto use, faster passage for broadly supported resolutions, and clearer legitimacy due to transparent credit expenditure.
- **Evaluation roadmap**: Classroom simulations, open-source experiments, expert labs, blockchain pilots, and iterative updates to transcript libraries and briefs.
