# UN Security Council Voting Reform Dossier

This brief distills the Week 6 reflection on overhauling United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voting rules. It records the case narrative, strategic preferences, Nobel-inspired mechanism insights, and the proposed quadratic voting experiment that informed the quadratic-transcript generation workstream.

## Case Narrative: Removing the Veto

- **Setting**: The UNSC debating a humanitarian intervention without the Permanent Five (P5) veto.
- **Visual prompt**: Council chamber in session, usually requiring nine affirmative votes plus zero P5 vetoes.
- **Problem**: The veto safeguards great-power buy-in but routinely stalls action—Russia/USSR has exercised 159 vetoes, the United States 93, China 21, while the UK and France have abstained from vetoes since 1989.
- **Reform question**: What shifts if the veto disappears in favour of supermajority or intensity-weighted voting?

### Policy Menu Considered

1. **Option A – Strong Intervention**: Authorise a robust peace-enforcement mission to halt violence.
2. **Option B – Limited Sanctions & Mediation**: Deploy targeted sanctions and mediation teams without armed force.
3. **Option C – No Action / Status Quo**: Issue statements of concern while avoiding sanctions or intervention.

### Preference Blocks (Rankings from Most to Least Preferred)

| Stakeholder | Preference Order | Motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Western Bloc (US, UK, France) | A → B → C | Favour decisive intervention to uphold peace and human rights.
| Opposing Bloc (Russia, China) | C → B → A | Prioritise sovereignty and resist intervention precedents.
| Emerging Powers (India, Brazil, etc.) | B → A → C | Seek a compromise that preserves action without full militarisation.
| Affected Region & Allies | A → B → C | Demand robust intervention; see inaction as untenable.

With vetoes removed, the majority coalition could pass Option A, yet legitimacy hinges on keeping powerful dissenters engaged.

## Mechanism-Design and Nobel Insights

- **Buchanan (1986)**: Frames veto rights as a unanimity device among great powers. Removing them lowers decision costs but risks imposing higher losses on minorities unless supermajority thresholds or side-payments mitigate fears of domination.
- **Hurwicz–Maskin–Myerson (2007)**: Highlight that rule design must align incentives. Veto threats extract concessions; alternative mechanisms should reward honest revelation (e.g., Vickrey–Clarke–Groves-style credits) and enforce accountability for blocking widely supported measures.
- **Shapley–Roth (2012)**: Emphasise stability. Issue bundling, rotations, and compensations (guided by Shapley values) can keep pivotal members from defecting when vetoes vanish.
- **Acemoglu–Johnson–Robinson (2024)**: Stress that inclusive institutions boost legitimacy. Abolishing the veto widens participation but requires norms, transparency, and safeguards to prevent backlash from erstwhile veto players.

## Forward-Looking Design Challenge

### Quadratic Voting with Veto Credits

- Each member receives an issue-specific credit budget; casting more votes grows quadratically costly (1 credit → 1 vote, 4 credits → 2 votes, 9 credits → 3 votes).
- Weighted yes/no tallies balance intensity and fairness: powerful states can still prevail on vital issues but must prioritise.
- Credits and rationales are recorded on a permissioned blockchain for auditability, while algorithmic assistants simulate strategic responses to calibrate budgets and carryover caps.

#### Anticipated Benefits

- **Fairness**: Equal budgets empower smaller states to signal intensity.
- **Stability**: High-stakes victories remain possible for powerful actors who spend their limited credits judiciously.
- **Efficiency**: Broadly supported resolutions pass with fewer artificial blocks.
- **Legitimacy**: Transparent credit spending makes influence observable and contestable.

### Testing Plan

1. Classroom and Model UN simulations compare baseline veto rules with quadratic voting.
2. Open-source code experiments stress-test parameter choices and AI-supported deliberation.
3. Expert lab studies elicit strategic responses to credit prices and action menus.
4. Blockchain testnets evaluate the audit layer.
5. Iterative refinements feed updated transcripts and policy briefs.
