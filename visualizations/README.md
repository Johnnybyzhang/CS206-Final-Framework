# Visualizations – Auction & Voting Evidence

This folder stores the figures and summary tables cited across the report and README. All assets are generated by [`generate_figures.py`](generate_figures.py) using data from the simulator and the quadratic-voting transcripts.

## Artefacts

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `auctions/revenue_by_round.png` | Line chart showing revenue decay as budgets tighten across 40 rounds. |
| `auctions/winners_curse_frequency.png` | Bar plot of winner's-curse frequency aggregated by 10-round windows. |
| `voting/credit_option_heatmap.png` | Heatmap of UNSC quadratic-voting decisions by veto-credit endowment. |
| `voting/decision_summary.json` | Machine-readable counts of decisions, used for reproducibility checks. |

## Reproducing the Figures

```bash
python generate_figures.py
```

Running the script refreshes all images after re-running the simulator (if needed) and re-parsing transcript counts. The script requires the Python dependencies listed in [`../requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

## Usage Notes

- Figures export at 300 DPI, suitable for inclusion in the PDF report.
- The decision heatmap reveals that zero-credit delegates overwhelmingly choose abstention or approval, whereas nine-credit delegates skew toward hard declines—evidence cited in Part 3 when motivating transparency safeguards.
- Winner's-curse events cluster in the first 20 rounds, aligning with the behavioural discussion in [`../behavioral_scientist/triangulation.md`](../behavioral_scientist/triangulation.md).
